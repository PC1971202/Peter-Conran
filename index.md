        <h2>INTEREST IN I.T.</h2>
        <p>
    Computers weren’t readily available when I was younger. Even in the 80s when the home computer became available, they were still relatively expensive and out of the price range of most households. As they were highly limited in their ability (no internet in those days, very few programs), most families instead invested in the cheaper alternative; video game consoles. It wasn’t until the late 90s when home computers lowered in price and opened up a whole new world for me. As I worked in the sound industry, the ability to record digitally and do non-destructive editing was a major breakthrough as well as the creation of ‘in-the-box’ mixing. This, combined with the internet, opened my eyes to how the world was changing. Unfortunately, years of doing live sound has resulted in 2 back surgeries so it’s time for a change of career.  20 years of troubleshooting and organisational skills are ready to be transferred to a new occupation.

        <h2>PROJECT IDEAS</h2>
        
        <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    My idea is a motorcycle GPS that does more than show you the route; it also shows you the weather along the route and gives the rider warnings about upcoming rain by connecting to the riders mobile phone and downloading updated data at intervals specified by the user. It is primarily software that can use existing cheaper GPS units that are running Windows CE, which are also equipped with Bluetooth connectivity ability. 
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
    In 2018, it was estimated that there were around 861,000 registered motorcycles in Australia. As a rider myself, I have often taken long rides such as Wollongong to Melbourne and Wollongong to Noosa. Since these rides cover a great distance and take a great deal of time, I’ve often found myself having to check the weather reports for other towns along the ride and then calculating where I will be and at what time to see whether I encounter any rain.  It can be time-consuming and require a fair bit of calculating, so an easier way is needed. 
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    For the sake of the description, the GPS unit aspect of it will be referred to as a “program” and the mobile phone side of it will be referred to as an “app”.
    </p>
    <p>
Firstly, the program would need to be a self-contained GPS program similar to I-Go but with added enhancements. It would need to access a weather site, like accuweather or weatherzone. The source of the weather information would need to have the ability to calculate the weather hourly. The program wouldn’t access the weather site until a route had been planned. From there, it would search the weather website for the towns along the route and download their hourly weather information for the duration of the ride. Initially, the program would begin calculating from the moment the GPS route is defined like a normal GPS, however there will also be the option to input the theoretical time and date the trip would be starting. There would be a warning that this information is liable to change (the warning would have a “do not show this again” checkbox to prevent it being annoying on each route plan) but it would help the rider work out the best time to ride.</p>
<p>
Another aspect would be a weather-based trip planner. The rider would input the route and the GPS would instruct the rider the best time to leave in order to avoid rain. The rider would be warned if the route would have rain along the way. </P>
<p>
If a rider is riding towards rain, the program would have a small red warning in the upper corner to alert the rider. As it would be impossible to know the exact time rain would start, it would simply say “Rain Predicted” and would disappear once the rider left the affected area. Other warnings could be “Rain Possible” or “Strong Wind Warning” which can also prove hazardous to riders.</p>
The mobile app would be the data link for the program. Once paired, the GPS would connect to the app. I think the app should be the brain where the weather data retrieval is done, then sent to the program. On the app, the user would previously specify how often the data is accessed, though this would be overridden if the possibility of rain increases once the rider is on the road. In this situation, the app would default to updating its weather data once an hour, regardless of the user settings.
The program software would be loadable into an existing GPS unit such as the one sold by FODSports. These are generic GPS units, badged by companies who didn’t develop them and then they install third-party software such as I-Go to cover their navigation needs.  As their maps are loaded onto a microSD card in a card slot, any new program would also be able to access them if needed. These GPS units are perfect since they are designed to be used by riders wearing gloves, which can be a problem with using a car GPS unit on a bike.

    </p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>
    FODSports 5 Inch Motorcycle Bluetooth Waterproof GPS Navigation for Car/Motorbike - Running Windows CE and relatively inexpensive, this unit is perfect for what is required.<br>
      Bluetooth Radar – This is a windows program for Bluetooth connections, though I’m not sure if I need this.<br>
      APK Pure Designer Tools – This app developer would be used to design the app for the mobile. It would need to be able to access the weather sites and connect through the phone to the GPS to pass data back and forth when required.<br>
      Eclipse IDE for Java Developers – This will be used for the bulk of the programming.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>
    To start, analytical skills are needed to break the idea down in order to determine how to work on it. Creativity would be used to design the GUI that would give the rider the information they need. This type of idea would require multiple people working on different aspects of it, so a thorough knowledge of the programming language for what they’re working on, coupled with good communication skills are required. Once written, there would need to be skills in problem solving to troubleshoot any problems and be able to finalise a working product, both in functionality and usefulness. 
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
    The best outcome would be a working GPS program for motorcycle riders that would fill a hole in the market by also factoring weather conditions into every ride. In my experience, I have yet to find a motorcycle GPS unit that does this. Advancement like this would prove very popular with motorcyclists worldwide. Up to date weather information is impossible to access while riding and yet it is the most necessary information needed. This app would pave the way for other developments, such as snow or black ice warnings.
